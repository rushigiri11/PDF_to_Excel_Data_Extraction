# PDF Data Extractor and Excel Writer

This repository contains a Python-based solution designed to extract specific data from multiple PDF files and compile the extracted information into an Excel file. Utilizing the PyMuPDF library for PDF processing and the openpyxl library for Excel file handling, this project automates the extraction and organization of data from a folder of PDF files into a structured Excel spreadsheet.

## Features

- PDF Data Extraction: Extracts specified fields from PDFs using regex patterns.
- Data Transformation: Splits a location field into district, taluka, and village fields.
- Excel Writing: Writes the extracted data to an Excel file with appropriate column headings.
- Indexing: Adds an index to each row in the Excel file for easy reference.


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- The following Python libraries:
    - PyMuPDF (fitz)
    - openpyxl
